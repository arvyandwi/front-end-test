# front-end-test
A simple form website for front-end test.

The task is to create a registration form using html and css. I use Bootstrap 5 for the styling.

The country code is using a reference from https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input. As for the country/location is using a reference from https://github.com/mrmarkfrench/country-select-js.
